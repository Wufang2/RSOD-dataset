# RSOD-Dataset

It is an open dataset for object detection in remote sensing images. The dataset includes aircraft, oiltank, playground and overpass.

The format of this dataset is PASCAL VOC.

The dataset includes 4 files, and each file is for one kind of object. Please download the dataset files from BaiduYun.
1. [aircraft dataset](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1eRWFV5C), 4993 aircrafts in 446 images.
2. [playground](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1nuD4KLb), 191 playgrounds in 189 images.
3. [overpass](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1kVKAFB5), 180 overpasses in 176 images.
4. [oiltank](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1kUZn4zX), 1586 oiltanks in 165 images.
